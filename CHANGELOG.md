  * Chnges to database are communicated via PubSub and use an Oid to indicate what thing changed and an array of deltas to indicate what attributes changed
  * topics have 'Model' removed from name. Uses the scope name assigned to the dbModel during intiSequelize for publish: For subscribe, the capitalizedName passed into the BaseResolver is used.
  * the gqlSubscription on the nodeREsolver (ie you can subscribe to all changes to any node) now uses the scope of the oid to find the appropriate service rather than using class names

  

## [3.1.2] -- 2020-01-31

### Added
  * (quick hack) Optional trailing parameter `order` on SequelizeBaseService.getAssociatedMany()

## [3.1.1] -- 2020-01-25

## [3.0.3] -- 2020-01-23

  * BREAKING CHANGE  * removed modelToClass in favor of SequelizeBaseServiceInterface.gqlFromDbModel()

### Changed
  * BREAKING CHANGE: Changed extended ACL logic to queries, updates. 
    * REQUIRES the method SequelizeBaseService.addAuthorizationFilters to be called on a sequelize FindOptions object before any sequelize 'find' operation is called
  * createWhereClauseFilter(filter) now calls convertToSequelizeDateFilters(filter) so both oids and DateRanges are converted to sequelize filters
### Fixed
  * createWhereClause correctly checks the type of an id before trying to coerce to a database id

### Changed

## [1.1.0] -- 2019-12-10

* This DOES NOT propagate to the GqlSubscriptions, as sending all the deltas to any old client is a big security hole.

reloadFromModel when there was NO custom getter, referenced to the data rather than cloned

## [1.0.1] -- 2019-10-30

### Changed
  * Peer dependency for `@rumbleship/oid` updated to 1.0.2

## [1.0.0] -- 2019-10-30
